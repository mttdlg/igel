key2 | handle2

Certification Entity:

Takes handle, required certification.

Returns whether handle is certified as requested.

For later: allow different certification entities, 
depending on whom you want to trust: for instance,
once program has been debugged and optimized, a
specific runtime certification for a
time-critical section might be a NOP (optimized away)
