syntax-check: just check that syntax is correct.
    * Might be run standalone.
    * Might be run together with interpretation.
    * /Could/ it be run without interpretation after debugging, to save time?
      Maybe interpretation can *require* a syntax check, but if it is not
      explicitly required, it will be skipped?
      What about if/then/else where we build up as part of interpretation?
      Would that be duplicated effort?
      Can we sort of streamline it?
