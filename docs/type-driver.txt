Consider having a 'type driver' (somewhat related to the kind, but not
exactly the same thing) or a 'type wrapper' (which might
replace the 'drawer' / 'valbox'? Would it be part of the value,
or of the referent?)

item {
    now.type -> contains methods. It's kind of like a Lua metatable
    hash
}

* Potential entries for type driver:

// conventional naming:
- get <...>
- set <...>

// example for some types
  [int.get n]      -> n
  [int.set ...]    -> error

  [array.get a idx]     -> return contents
  [array.set a idx val] -> do it
  [array.set a b ... val] -> delegate
