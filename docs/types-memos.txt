# Note: what you are interested in is probably some form
# of structural subtyping

#
# Toy problem to help understand the situation:
# consider the following types:
#
# int8
# int16
# bool
# string
#
# A few example functions (add, xor, or, and, cat)
#
# and try to construct a type system that works for both
# compilation and RTL synthesis
#
