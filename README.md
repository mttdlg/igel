# IGEL
Interpreter/Generator for Experimenting with Languages

This is a personal hobby project where I try my hand at designing and implementing a programming language.
Proof of concept code is written. Notes about possible features or their implementation are jotted down as comments, strewn across files.

At the moment the codebase implements the core of an interpreter which can execute simple programs like printing the lyrics of "99 bottles of beer" or calculating the greatest common divisor using Euclid's algorithm.

Needless to say, it can print "Hello, world!"

Maybe one day it will grow into a complete interpreter or even a compiler.

The core is still incomplete: error handling is partial, the type system is mostly placeholder code.

Due to the "scrapbook" nature of development, where ideas are jotted down as they come, many comments might be obsolete, and there might be internal contradictions between comments. Many comments were jotted down as a possible approach, but not all of them are viable (some of them have even been obsoleted by the actual implementation).
