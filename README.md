Interpreter/Generator for Experimenting with Languages

This is a personal hobby project where I try my hand at designing and implementing a programming language.
I jot down various possible approaches, and write proof of concept code.
Maybe one day it will grow into a complete interpreter or even a compiler.

Due to the "scrapbook" nature of development, where ideas are jotted down as they come, many comments might be obsolete, and there might be internal contradictions between comments. Many comments were jotted down as a possible approach, but not all of them are viable (some of them have even been obsoleted by the actual implementation).
