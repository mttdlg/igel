Defininig the guidelines of the language.

Main guideline:

"The programmer should not do work to make the compiler happy,
 the compiler should do work to make the programmer happy."

# Take heavy inspiration from The Zen of Python 
Safe should be default.
Fast should be possible.
When in doubt, fail.
When you fail, fail spectacularly.
